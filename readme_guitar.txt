The RingBuffer may be useful for other programs, too - it essentially just
  simulates a queue, which is a versatile class of objects.

three or four TAs in office hours! No one writes their names on the board,

Oh gosh, decision time. Perhaps Mozart? Beethoven?
  For now I'm going to go with Ode To Joy.

  I really liked this assignment! It was manageable and also pretty cool.
  I still can't say I fully understand the sound mechanism and how we produced
  the twangy sound of a guitar string, but the fact that we did is pretty sweet. 
  Keep the fun assignments coming! :) (maybe not the encode/decode assignment again though)
